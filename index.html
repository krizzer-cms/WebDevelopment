  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I currently reside in Silverdale, WA with my wife and daughter.
    I have a Master's in Engineering Management from Old Dominion University
    and a Mechanical Engineering B.S.E. from Arizona State University. I served
    as a Lieutenant on nuclear submarines for over 6 years and gained invaluable
    technical knowledge and skills that I can use forever. I'm a certified Project
    Manager Professional (PMP) and Agile-Certified Practitioner (ACP) with all my
    experience collaborating with teams and leading multiple mission critical projects.
    I've been trusted to operate a multi-billion dollar submarine and nuclear power
    plant while on deployment and experienced first-hand the massive responsibility
    entrusted to me. That same trust I build is inherent in managing your properties.
    I was frustrated with the lack of responsibility others took of my property so
    I decided to found my own property management company so I can bring high-quality
    service to my customers. I guarantee, once we are responsible for your property,
    we will take care of your real estate so you can continue about your lives without
    worry.</p>
